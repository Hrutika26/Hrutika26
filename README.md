### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm Hrutika, a full-stack developer and graduate student based in Boston, MA.

I'm currently working as a **Full-Stack Developer Intern at [CareerGPT](https://github.com/careergpt)**, where I help develop **AI-powered job discovery tools** and improve the user experience through clean, functional code and thoughtful design.

I'm passionate about building products that are not just functional, but also intuitive and user-friendly. I enjoy bringing clarity and order to complex problems, whether it's through writing clean code or streamlining workflows.

Outside of tech, I love organizing â€” from personal spaces to daily routines. I believe that structure fosters creativity and productivity, and I carry that mindset into my work and life.

I'm graduating in **May 2026** and actively looking for **early career and entry-level roles** in tech.
